				Tosin's Bakery is a <strong> family </strong> owned pastry shop, and we place an emphasis on family in all we do. We were introduced to baking from a young age thanks to our grandmother, Tosin, and all our memories of the kitchen are shrouded in love and warm feelings. Our childhoods were filled with houses smelling deliciously of cookies and other baked wonders, and our grandmother always shared her pastries with community members. After she passed on, we decided to help our grandmother realize her dream of owning a bakery. We sincerely hope that all who patronize us are reminded of happy memories, as everyday is a constant reminder of what we loved for us.

			</p>

			<p>

				As a result of our faimilial and warm connection to the kitchen, we are dedicated to infusing our baked goods with warmth, positive energy and good vibes. We believe in the transformative properties of thoughts and energy, and hope to always maintain a pastry shop that emits goodness into the air. 

			</p>

			<p>

				Our team is made up of family members, and friends who have become family over time. We love surrounding ourselves with warm, loving, interesting and jovial people, and that is what our shop is all about.
